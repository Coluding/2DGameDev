## 2D Game Dev

This repository showcases a simple 2D Jump & Run game that I developed to improve my C++ skills and explore game development from the ground up.

### Why
Building this game serves two purposes:

- Improving C++ Skills: The project helps me enhance my proficiency in C++ by implementing core game mechanics, rendering, physics, and other fundamental systems manually, instead of relying heavily on prebuilt engines.

- Foundation for Reinforcement Learning: The game is designed to be a custom environment where I can later train reinforcement learning (RL) agents. By building the game from scratch, I have complete control over the environment dynamics, allowing for tailored experiments and optimizations with RL agents.

### Features
- Custom Physics: Implements simple physics for character movement and interactions.
- Obstacle Mechanics: Includes a variety of obstacles and platforms for the Jump & Run gameplay.
- Extendable Design: The game's architecture is modular, making it easy to extend with new levels, mechanics, or visual effects.

### Future Plans
- Integration with RL Frameworks: Use the game as a custom environment to train RL agents, implementing the interaction logic in JAX and Flax.
- Enhanced Features: Add dynamic level generation, power-ups, or enemy AI for more complexity.
- Visualization Improvements: Upgrade graphics and UI for better player and agent feedback.
